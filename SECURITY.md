## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to [INSERT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS] with all the relevant information. We will do our best to promptly address any reported vulnerabilities.

Please include the following details:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Possible ways to mitigate or fix the vulnerability

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly resolve any confirmed vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability has been addressed, we will release a new version of the project and provide credits to those who reported the vulnerability.

**Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.**

## Security Best Practices

While using this project, we recommend following these security best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date**: Regularly update the project dependencies to their latest versions. Outdated dependencies may contain known vulnerabilities.

2. **Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, directly in the codebase. Instead, use environment variables to keep sensitive data separate from the code.

3. **Implement Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive parts of the application or data.

4. **Validate User Input**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

5. **Implement Secure Communication**: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) when transmitting sensitive data over the network.

6. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users and processes only the minimum permissions and privileges required to perform their tasks.

7. **Keep Your Environment Secure**: Keep your operating system, libraries, and other dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

8. **Regularly Audit and Monitor**: Regularly audit your codebase and infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities, and monitor for any suspicious activities.

By following these best practices and staying vigilant about security, you can help ensure the overall security of your application and protect your users' data.
